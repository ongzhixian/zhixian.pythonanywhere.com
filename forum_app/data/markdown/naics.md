# North American Industry Classification System (NAICS)

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is used by businesses and governments to classify 
and measure economic activity in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. 

NAICS is 6-digit code system that is the current standard used by federal statistical agencies 
in classifying establishments (individual business locations). 

NAICS organizes establishments into industries according to the similarity 
in the processes used to produce goods or services.

NAICS codes array the economy into 20 sectors, which are separated into 96 3-digit subsectors, which are divided into 308 4-digit industry groups, which are further subdivided into 689 5-digit industries, and finally disaggregated into 1012 6-digit U.S. industries.
