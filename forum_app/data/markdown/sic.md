# Standard Industrial Classification (SIC)

Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes are four-digit numerical codes 
assigned by the U.S. government to business establishments to identify the primary business of the establishment. 

The classification was developed to facilitate the collection, presentation and analysis of data; 
and to promote uniformity and comparability in the presentation of statistical data collected 
by various agencies of the federal government, state agencies and private organizations. 

The classification covers all economic activities.

The SIC system arrays the economy into 11 divisions, that are divided into 83 2-digit major groups, that are further subdivided into 416 3-digit industry groups, and finally disaggregated into 1,005 4-digit industries.
