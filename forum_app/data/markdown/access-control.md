# Topics on access control

What is RBAC?

Role-based access control (RBAC) is a security approach that authorizes and restricts system access to users based on their role(s) within an organization. This method allows users to access the data and applications needed to fulfill their job requirements and minimizes the risk of unauthorized employees accessing sensitive information or performing unauthorized tasks. In addition to restricting access, RBAC can define how a user interacts with data—permitting read-only or read/write access to certain roles, thus limiting a user’s ability to execute commands or delete information. 

What is ABAC?

Organizations use attribute-based access control (ABAC) to achieve more fine-grained access control—either replacing or supplementing RBAC. The difference between RBAC and ABAC stems from the way each method manages access. Unlike RBAC, which grants access according to predefined roles, ABAC is a security policy that relies on a combination of attributes to match users with the resources they need to do a job.

What is PBAC?

Policy-Based Access Control (PBAC) is another access management strategy that focuses on authorization. Whereas RBAC restricts user access based on static roles, PBAC determines access privileges dynamically based on rules and policies. Although PBAC is fairly similar to ABAC, ABAC requires more IT and development resources (e.g., XML coding) as the number of required attributes increases.


What is ACL?

Access control lists (ACL) control or restrict the flow of traffic through a digital environment. ACL rules grant or deny access in two general categories:

What is DAC?

Whereas RBAC, also known as non-discretionary access control, takes a more human-level approach to controlling access, Discretionary Access Control (DAC) uses ACLs to restrict access to resources, such as files and database tables, and define which privileges a user has for that resource.
