      IPF - Investment Portfolio (Management System)
      What should I be able to do as a 'portfolio administrator'?
      1. View portfolios
      2. Manage portfolio
         When we say management portfolio, we mean we can:
         1) Add a new portfolio
         2) Allocate assets
      3. View holdings and performance bar-chart based on search filter

      Order Entry:
      1. Basic order validation
      2. Balance check before trade is booked
      3. Integration with mock legacy application 
         (and allow multiple transaction process with SLA of 1 sec)

      Transaction History:
      1. View Order History (based on Search filter)
      2. Transaction history report (hourly)

      Async Payment processing
      1. Everytime a a user attempts a payment with their credit card, a notification would be generated to inform or request confirmation
      2. Exception handling needs to be done in case order processing not done but payment is processed.
